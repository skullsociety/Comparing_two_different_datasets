# Comparing_two_different_datasets
Comparing 2 different datasets during my time at work. 
Especially useful to find the difference between different version of the same datafile that is compiled and handed over to me from other departments (that does not code). 
Eliminate a ton of frustration and save a lot of time.

Basically there is 5 functions.
Function 5 is the combinations of the previous 4.

More info by the python notebook file itself.
